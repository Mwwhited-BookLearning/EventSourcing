# Open Questions

A live tracker for genuinely unresolved questions — distinct from every
other document type here: an ADR (`docs/adrs/`) is a decision already
made; a comparison (`docs/comparisons/`) weighs a fork *before* a
decision; this file is for the fork that hasn't been weighed yet at all,
or a decision that was deliberately left partial.

**When a row gets resolved, delete it outright — don't strike it
through and retain it.** (Direction received this session, reversing an
earlier same-session correction that said the opposite.) Every resolved
row already has a real, permanent, scoped home: the ADR that resolved
it, or an existing ADR's additive addendum. Retaining a struck-through
copy here duplicates that home for no reason. The one-line historical
record of *what got resolved, when, by which ADR* lives in that day's
`docs/changes/{date}.md` instead — see `docs/changes/2026-07-31.md` for
this session's resolutions. If another doc cites this file by row
number, update that citation to point at the resolving ADR (or that
day's changelog) once the row is deleted — a row number is not a stable
long-term address.

**A row can also be deleted for a different reason: it turns out to be
genuinely domain-specific, not a framework-wide fork**, and gets
relocated to the owning domain's own `README.md` Special Concerns
section instead (e.g. algorithmic-bias auditing → `docs/domains/
insurance-telematics/README.md`; FDA's 15-day adverse-event clock →
`docs/domains/pharmacovigilance/README.md`). That's a "this never
belonged in the framework-level tracker" correction, not a resolution —
nothing is lost, the content lives on in the domain doc.

**Not included here, on purpose**:
- Domain-specific regulatory/compliance gaps found while reviewing one
  domain's own `README.md` — those live in that domain's own Special
  Concerns section, not here, even while genuinely unresolved.
- **Pure operations/deployment-process concerns with no architecture or
  development decision embedded** — alert thresholds, on-call rotation,
  paging policy, and similar. Confirmed explicitly this session (former
  row 7's residual, after `ADR-088` resolved the actual instrumentation
  half): these aren't merely deprioritized, they were never a fork this
  file should hold in the first place — no design decision is possible
  or needed at the framework level, only an operational runbook a
  deployment writes for itself.
- Anything deferred purely on scheduling with no open design question of
  its own (e.g. `ADR-007`, `ADR-009`'s masking-enforcement build — both
  fully designed, just sequenced later in `08-build-plan.md`). Those are
  priority calls, not open questions — see `CLAUDE.md`/`08-build-
  plan.md` for that distinction.
- Known propagation/documentation debt with no fork to weigh (a missing
  diagram, a stale Gherkin scenario) — tracked in `TODO.md`, not here.
- A question genuinely still open but explicitly **deprioritized** for
  now rather than resolved — noted in place, in the row itself, with a
  **Back-burnered** marker and the reason, rather than removed (nothing
  was decided, so there's no resolution to move elsewhere).

## How to add an entry

Found a real fork or an explicitly-left-open decision while writing an
ADR/pattern/comparison/library doc? Add a row here in the same pass —
don't let it live only as a buried sentence in that doc's Consequences
section where it's easy to lose track of.

| # | Question | Raised by | Why it's still open |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Should schema-registry state (`EventTypeDefinition` rows) actually replicate across peers via a real fold worker (mirroring `EventStore.DevIdp`'s `RbacProjectionWorker`, which already folds ITS OWN reserved control-plane events this way), or should `ADR-033`'s own text be permanently corrected to state that only the reserved `schemaregistered` *notification* event replicates, never the schema itself? | Found by actually running a real, genuine three-provider peer-sync mesh (`ADR-102`) and hitting a real GraphQL "field does not exist" error against two peers a schema was registered on only a third | Genuinely unresearched/undecided: `ADR-033`'s own additive correction (this session) documents the current, real behavior, but doesn't decide which of the two fixes is right — building the fold worker is real, non-trivial work (a new background service, an idempotency/versioning story for a schema update arriving out of order relative to events already using it); permanently downgrading the ADR's own claim is cheap but means every real multi-node deployment must register each schema identically on every peer by hand, forever. |
