Feature: OAuth2/OIDC bearer-token authentication and scope-based authorization
  As the event store
  I want every request authenticated via a Bearer token and authorized by scope
  So that only permitted services can publish, follow, query lineage, or administer schemas

  Background:
    Given the identity provider is a dev-mode Keycloak realm "event-store"
    And client "publisher-client" has scope "events:publish"
    And client "follower-client" has scopes "events:follow" and "events:lineage:read"
    And client "operator-client" has scope "registry:admin"
    And the event type "OrderPlaced" version 1 is registered with schema:
      """
      { "type": "object", "properties": { "Amount": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["Amount"] }
      """

  Scenario: Request without a Bearer token is rejected
    When I POST to "/publish/OrderPlaced" without an Authorization header
    Then the response status should be 401

  Scenario: Request with an expired or invalid Bearer token is rejected
    Given I have an expired Bearer token for client "publisher-client"
    When I POST to "/publish/OrderPlaced" with body:
      """
      { "payload": { "Amount": 150.00 } }
      """
    Then the response status should be 401

  Scenario: Request with a token lacking the required scope is rejected
    Given I have a Bearer token for client "follower-client"
    When I POST to "/publish/OrderPlaced" with body:
      """
      { "payload": { "Amount": 150.00 } }
      """
    Then the response status should be 403

  Scenario: Request with a token carrying the required scope succeeds
    Given I have a Bearer token for client "publisher-client"
    When I POST to "/publish/OrderPlaced" with body:
      """
      { "payload": { "Amount": 150.00 } }
      """
    Then the response status should be 201

  Scenario: Schema registration requires the registry:admin scope
    Given I have a Bearer token for client "follower-client"
    When I PUT "/registry/OrderPlaced" with body:
      """
      { "jsonSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "Amount": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["Amount"] }, "filterableFields": [] }
      """
    Then the response status should be 403

  Scenario: OpenAPI and AsyncAPI documents remain publicly readable
    When I GET "/openapi.json" without an Authorization header
    Then the response status should be 200
    When I GET "/asyncapi.json" without an Authorization header
    Then the response status should be 200

  Scenario: Browser-based SSE clients supply the token via query string, not a header
    Given I have a Bearer token for client "follower-client"
    When I open an SSE connection to "/follow/OrderPlaced?access_token=<token>"
    Then the connection should be accepted

  Scenario: An SSE connection with neither a header nor an access_token is rejected
    When I open an SSE connection to "/follow/OrderPlaced"
    Then the connection should be rejected with 401
